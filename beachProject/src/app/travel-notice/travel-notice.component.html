                <h3> How to Help Slow the Spread of COVID-19 </h3>
                <hr>
                <p> COVID-19 is mainly spread from person to person through respiratory droplets when an infected individual speaks, coughs, or sneezes at close range</p>
                <p> The CDC has also advised against touching a high-contact surface (such as door knobs) and then touching their own mouth, nose, or eyes, though this is not thought of as being the primary way the infection is passed.</p>
                <p>There is currently no vaccine against COVID-19. Here are some things you can do to help fight the spread of COVID-19. The WHO recommends:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Washing your hands regularly with an alcohol-based sanitizer, or with soap and water</li>
                    <li> Maintaining distance six feet of distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing</li>
                    <li>Avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth</li>
                    <li>Seeking medical care immediately if you are showing symptoms</li>
                </ul>
